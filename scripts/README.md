## How to use this shcript?

This thing will automatically get the latest stable version of `OpenWRT` 
and prepare the build env for cross-compiling (hopefully) Rust libraries into .ipk packages for Nym. 

Right now it should only do the gateway for the sake of simplicity but I think the build will fail anyway at this stage of my hacking. 

It will nevertheless, compile the whole OpenWRT without needing to manually do shit within the GUI image builder.

Also fancy ASCII art and colours coming soon lol.
